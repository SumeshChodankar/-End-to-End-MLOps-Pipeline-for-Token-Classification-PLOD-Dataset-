Designed and built a complete machine learning pipeline for multi-class scene recognition, from data preprocessing to model evaluation. This project involved developing and comparing advanced deep learning architectures to identify the most performant solution for deployment, demonstrating an understanding of the full machine learning lifecycle.

Problem: Classifying images into one of 40 scene categories from the PLACES2 dataset.

Methodology: Engineered a pipeline that included data augmentation to prevent overfitting. Compared two distinct architectures: a fine-tuned ResNet-34 and a Swin Transformer.

Training & Optimization: Implemented transfer learning and systematically tuned hyperparameters, including comparing Adam and SGD optimizers, to enhance model convergence.

Results: The ResNet-34 model achieved a Top-1 accuracy of 40.76% and a Top-5 accuracy of 74.16%, outperforming the Swin Transformer in this context.

Deployment: The project included a conceptual plan for deploying the final model as a REST API to serve predictions, showcasing an understanding of MLOps principles.
